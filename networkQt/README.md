I was contributing to a project of making a local network with 2 servers and one client that can send commands to and receive responses from the servers.
The networking code was made by [this person](https://github.com/Tomas542). Huge thanks to him for asking for my help.

My contribution is the Qt code with UI elements and the way they interact with the original client code.
